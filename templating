# Templating rules for Centreon Automatic Discovery
# It’a CSV file which uses `;` as separator, values are unquoted. Empty lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored.
# Fields are: <regex>;<host template(s)>;<host group(s)>;<service template for filesystems>
# Only the first matching row will be used to create the host. So order matters, you should order the rules starting with the most specific regex.
# The service template for filesystems must take 3 arguments: mount point, warn threshold in kiB free, crit threshold in kiB free

# Windows hosts
.*Windows.*;TH_SYS_WINDOWS;HG_TECH_WINDOWS;TS_SYS_WINDOWS_FS_FREE

# GNU/Linux hosts
# You can set more than one host template using `|` as separator (like you’d do if using Centreon CLAPI directly).
.*Linux.*;TH_SYS_LINUX|TH_SYS_POSIX;HG_TECH_LINUX;TS_SYS_UNIX_FS_FREE

# FreeBSD hosts
.*FreeBSD.*;TH_SYS_FREEBSD;HG_TECH_UNIX;TS_SYS_UNIX_FS_FREE

# Unix hosts
.*A(ix|IX).*;TH_SYS_AIX_AIX;HG_TECH_UNIX;TS_SYS_UNIX_FS_FREE

# This line should be the latest, as regex `.*` match anything.
.*;TH_SYS_HOST-ONLY
